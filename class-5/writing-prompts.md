###Lesson recap

**In JavaScript, what is a function and when might you want to create one?**
A function is a statement in Javascript that performs a given task or set of tasks that the programmer defines. Functions are useful if a similar task is going to be performed multiple times in any given program. We can simply write the code for the task once under the function, and then call that function again when we want the same code executed instead of writing it all out again.

**In CSS, what is the difference between a class and an id?**
In CSS, elements can be assigned different tags depending on their level of hierarchy. A class is defined with a . and an id is defined with a #. A class is more general than an id. A unique ID can only be assigned to one element, but multiple elements can share the same class

**In HTML, does the order of elements matter? Why?**
For visible elements on a page, the order of elements does matter, they will be drawn from the top down 
because the document is read in a cascading fashion, from the top down.

**When might you need to use an array? How about an object?**
You might use an array to store a list of values under the same category. You can then loop through these values or pull out a specific value from its place in the array. When we list coordinates, we use an array to do so. An object has many different uses, and can be used to store information or values under a certain name that we want to refer to later, such as information about people or a place that you want the user to be able to access. We can later pull up the value from the key it was assigned.
