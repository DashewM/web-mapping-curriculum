### How GitHub works (2 pts each)

**Describe what we mean when we say that GitHub is both “Git” and “Hub”.**
GitHub is both a code repository with version control and a collaborative workspace. The Git allows editing and tracking changes in real time, and requires detailed logs of those changes to be made, which makes for an optimal workspace. The Hub is collaborative and community-based. Features like issue tracking and pull requests making working as a team much more managable.

**Why might you want to fork a repository?**
Forking a repository is useful for a number of reasons. We might want to borrow someone else's code and modify it to fit our own needs for our own project. We might also want to experiment with a project we are working on and take it in a different direction without altering or damaging the original. 

### How the internet works (2 pts each)

**Why is HTTP a thing?**
HTTP is the basis for data communication on the web. it is based upon the relationship between a client and a server, where the client sends requests and the server recieves and interperets them. HTTP is the way these requests are organized, containing a head, body, and metainformation. The four types: GET, POST, DELETE, and PUT, are the sturcture of the Internet as we know it.

**What is an API and why do APIs like the deck of cards thing exist?**
An API is a set of functions and procedures allowing for the creation of applications. It is basically a prebuilt framework of predefined functions which can be applied and built upon to create things like applications. Things like the deck of cards API exist as a starting point or baseline for projects. People can utilize these APIs to make life more managable when starting a project as the framework already exsists and can then be built upon. For example, we could utilize the deck of cards API to create a Go Fish! app since the framework of drawing and shuffling cards already exists, but we would have to build the part that keeps track of what pairs you have, etc.

**Write about two kinds of HTTP requests you make in your daily life.**
When I log into my computer and want to watch a YouTube video, I'll click my YouTube bookmark in my browser. This sends a GET request to the server to request youtube.com, but doesn't ask for anything else. If I were to go on Twitter and post a funny tweet about my day, I would be sending a POST request to the server for my tweet to be posted to the server, as the metadata in this request tells the server this is a post.

**Why do some URLs have ?s and &s in them?**
Some URLs allow us to edit and customize parameters present within them. Everything before the ?, if it is present, is the base URL of the website. It exists to divide the base URL from the modifiable parameters. Each of these parameters is seperated by an & symbol.

### How webpages work (2 pts each)

**What's a good metaphor for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?**
HTML is like the structure of a house, the wood that holds it together. CSS is the aesthetics of the house: the color, how big the windows are, and how many balconies. Javascript is the functionality of the house: the Nest that modifies and controls the temperature, the automated garage door, the alarm that tells you when a window or door has been opened.

**What would you use Chrome Dev Tools for?**
Chrome Dev Tools is useful for a variety of reasons. It can be used to view the source code of a website. Maybe we want to see how a certain element is created so we can use it on our own website, or maybe we want to see what font is being used so we can also use it. We can also use Chrome Dev Tools to see what resources the site is accessing like photos, and it can even be used to change the site in order to do things like cheat at games.

**What is the JavaScript console?**
The JavaScript console is an essential piece of JavaScript which allows you to do things like define values, log things to JavaScript, and execute lines of code. It has built in functions, but functions can also be added to it. It is neccesary for building interactivity on webpages.
